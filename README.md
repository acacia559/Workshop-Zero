I started by using the example in the p5.js library which had a describe function as apart of the example and then decided to go back to my workshop notes and scratch that. I'm not a very "techy" person so I just took small steps like changing the colours and then sort of hit a wall with having the sketch move across the page. I ended up just reffering back to the workshop to aide in this hiccup.

I often found myself stumped when a code wouldn't work and then I would look back just to find it was a typo. For example having auto capitalisation on for new lines or typing out my full thoughts rather than just the code needed.

I did another shape but I didn't realy want to repeat myself by doing the same variations so i left it at that for the day and will experiment furt5her in the other workshop tasks.
