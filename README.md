I started by using the example in the p5.js library which had a describe function as apart of the example and then decided to go back to my workshop notes and scratch that. I'm not a very "techy" person so I just took small steps like changing the colours and then sort of hit a wall with having the sketch move across the page. I ended up just reffering back to the workshop to aide in this hiccup.
